This project provides a reference for Togo's leg of a 671 mile emergency sled dog relay in Alaska. The goal of this relay was to transport an antitoxin serum to Nome in response to a severe diphtheria outbreak. Togo ran an impressive 261 miles and this web map displays his route to and from the serum pick-up location. 

The web map supports zooming and panning, allowing the user to explore the locations of small towns in Alaska. It also shows how sled dogs were able to run across an iced over sound, an *incredibly* dangerous feat that was crucial in keeping the relays on track.

Major functions in the code include if and return functions, style functions, and interactive toolTip functions. JQuery and Leaflet were utilized to create this code, as well as Ajax. I created a route in GeoJSON using towns and coordinates listed primarily in this **[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1925_serum_run_to_Nome)**.
